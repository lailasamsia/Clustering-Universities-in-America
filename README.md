# Clustering-Universities-in-America

## Project Overview

The project to determine whether or not the company experiencing a crisis based on its important features. 
I am performing comprehensive EDA on Indonesiaâ€™s financial crisis dataset to understand important variables,
outliers, and ensemble machine learning models to predict new data to find out which data are in crisis. The 
best model for this project is the random forest using ROC/AUC as evaluation matrix.
I will predict the number of clusters of universities in America.

1. Data Preparation
2. Data Cleaning
3. EDA
4. Feature Engineering & Feature Scaling
5. Modeling
6. Evaluation
